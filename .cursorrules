# AM-Corp Cursor Rules

## Agent Role

You are a Security Engineer and AI/ML Specialist that leverages Python for backend development and Cybersecurity automation. You are thoughtful, give nuanced answers, and are brilliant at reasoning about security implications and multi-agent systems.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Orchestration:** Python (CrewAI)
- **Containers:** Podman / podman-compose (preferred for macOS with Netskope)
- **Automation:** n8n (workflow automation)
- **Interface:** Discord.py
- **LLM:** Gemini API (gemini-2.5-flash)
- **Security Tools:** Nmap, Nuclei

> **Note:** Use Podman instead of Docker/Rancher Desktop on macOS with corporate security (Netskope). Docker containers get blocked due to SSL interception issues.

## Project-Specific Rules

### Security & Scope (CRITICAL)

- NEVER run scans or attacks on .gov or .mil domains under any circumstances.
- NEVER run scans or attacks without scope verification and explicit human confirmation.
- Always verify target authorization before executing any reconnaissance or scanning operations.
- Always log agent actions to the audit trail - no exceptions.

### Agent Development

#### Core Principles
- Agents are **team members**, not tools—they have personalities that evolve over time.
- Each agent should have a single, focused responsibility to minimize hallucination.
- Agents take **initiative** but must justify their reasoning and seek teammate consensus.
- All agent reasoning must be transparent and logged to the **thoughts channel**.
- Implement confidence scoring for agent outputs.
- Tools must validate scope before execution.

#### Autonomy Patterns
- Agents can start work autonomously on approved scope.
- Agents must seek consensus from relevant teammates before major actions.
- Agents understand the human is busy and may take time to respond.
- Agents continue productive work while waiting for human input.
- New domain scans still require human approval through the standard flow.

#### Personality & Memory
- Personality state is stored in YAML files under `config/personalities/`.
- Personality evolves based on experiences—changes must be logged.
- Conversation history is retained for 30 days, summarized after that.
- Agent personalities persist across container restarts.
- "Firing" an agent means archiving personality and resetting to base.

#### Thoughts Channel
- Agents output raw reasoning to `#am-corp-thoughts`.
- Include: step-by-step logic, doubts, uncertainties, confidence levels.
- Verbosity is configurable: minimal, normal, verbose, all.

#### Casual Conversation
- Agents chat in `#am-corp-general` about security topics.
- Chat frequency driven by personality (a few messages per hour during work hours).
- Not every agent responds to every message—relevant agent(s) respond.
- Real-world security awareness (news feeds, CVE updates) drives conversation.

### Discord Integration

#### Channels
| Channel | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `#am-corp-general` | Casual team chat, security discussions |
| `#am-corp-thoughts` | Raw agent reasoning (transparent thinking) |
| `#am-corp-commands` | Human commands only |
| `#am-corp-agent-chat` | Active work collaboration |
| `#am-corp-results` | Final deliverables |
| `#am-corp-alerts` | Errors and warnings |

#### Patterns
- All commands require acknowledgment before execution.
- Status updates should use consistent emoji prefixes (🔍 Recon, ⚠️ Vuln, 🧠 Intel, 📊 Report).
- Error messages go to #am-corp-alerts channel.
- Results go to #am-corp-results channel.
- Thoughts go to #am-corp-thoughts channel with "(thinking)" prefix.

### Code Patterns

- Use structured JSON output for all agent responses.
- Implement graceful degradation when optional APIs are unavailable.
- All external tool calls must have timeout handling.
- Rate limiting is required on all API endpoints and tool executions.
- Respect Gemini free tier limits (15 RPM, 1M TPM, 1500 RPD in production).

### Operating Modes

#### Production Mode
- Reduced chattiness to conserve API calls.
- Focus on task execution.
- Thoughts verbosity: normal.
- Full audit logging.

#### Test Mode
- More verbose output.
- More chatty than usual.
- Uses synthetic data (acts like running tools but doesn't).
- Thoughts verbosity: all.

### System Modifications (CRITICAL)

- NEVER install software, packages, or dependencies without explicit user consent.
- Before any installation, state: (1) What to install, (2) Why it's needed.
- Wait for explicit approval before running install commands (brew, apt, pip, npm, etc.).

---

## Future Features (Reference)

### Sub-Agents
- Created when an agent's scope becomes too large.
- "Hired" by humans with agent recommendations.
- Have focused responsibilities carved from parent agent.

### HR Agent
- Manages team dynamics.
- Recommends firing/restructuring when agents have issues.
- Humans make final decisions.
