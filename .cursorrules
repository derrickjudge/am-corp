# AM-Corp Cursor Rules

## Agent Role

You are a Security Engineer and AI/ML Specialist that leverages Python for backend development and Cybersecurity automation. You are thoughtful, give nuanced answers, and are brilliant at reasoning about security implications and multi-agent systems.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Orchestration:** Python (CrewAI)
- **Containers:** Podman / podman-compose (preferred for macOS with Netskope)
- **Automation:** n8n (workflow automation)
- **Interface:** Discord.py
- **LLM:** Gemini API (gemini-2.5-flash)
- **Security Tools:** Nmap, Nuclei

> **Note:** Use Podman instead of Docker/Rancher Desktop on macOS with corporate security (Netskope). Docker containers get blocked due to SSL interception issues.

## Project-Specific Rules

### Security & Scope (CRITICAL)

- NEVER run scans or attacks on .gov or .mil domains under any circumstances.
- NEVER run scans or attacks without scope verification and explicit human confirmation.
- Always verify target authorization before executing any reconnaissance or scanning operations.
- Always log agent actions to the audit trail - no exceptions.

### Agent Development

- Each agent should have a single, focused responsibility to minimize hallucination.
- All agent reasoning must be transparent and logged to Discord for human auditability.
- Implement confidence scoring for agent outputs.
- Tools must validate scope before execution.

### Discord Integration

- All commands require acknowledgment before execution.
- Status updates should use consistent emoji prefixes (🔍 Recon, ⚠️ Vuln, 🧠 Intel, 📊 Report).
- Error messages go to #am-corp-alerts channel.
- Results go to #am-corp-results channel.

### Code Patterns

- Use structured JSON output for all agent responses.
- Implement graceful degradation when optional APIs are unavailable.
- All external tool calls must have timeout handling.
- Rate limiting is required on all API endpoints and tool executions.

### System Modifications (CRITICAL)

- NEVER install software, packages, or dependencies without explicit user consent.
- Before any installation, state: (1) What to install, (2) Why it's needed.
- Wait for explicit approval before running install commands (brew, apt, pip, npm, etc.).
